# keycloak\_openid\_client\_authorization\_policy Data Source

This data source can be used to fetch policy and permission information for an OpenID client that has authorization enabled.

## Example Usage

In this example, we'll create a new OpenID client with authorization enabled. This will cause Keycloak to create a default
permission for this client called "Default Permission". We'll use the `keycloak_openid_client_authorization_policy` data
source to fetch information about this permission, so we can use it to create a new resource-based authorization permission.

```hcl
resource "keycloak_realm" "realm" {
  realm   = "my-realm"
  enabled = true
}

resource "keycloak_openid_client" "client_with_authz" {
  client_id = "client-with-authz"
  name      = "client-with-authz"
  realm_id  = keycloak_realm.realm.id

  access_type              = "CONFIDENTIAL"
  service_accounts_enabled = true

  authorization {
    policy_enforcement_mode = "ENFORCING"
  }
}

data "keycloak_openid_client_authorization_policy" "default_permission" {
  realm_id           = keycloak_realm.test.id
  resource_server_id = keycloak_openid_client.client_with_authz.resource_server_id
  name               = "Default Permission"
}

resource "keycloak_openid_client_authorization_resource" "resource" {
  resource_server_id = keycloak_openid_client.client_with_authz.resource_server_id
  name               = "authorization-resource"
  realm_id           = keycloak_realm.test.id

  uris = [
    "/endpoint/*",
  ]

  attributes = {
    "foo" = "bar"
  }
}

resource "keycloak_openid_client_authorization_permission" "permission" {
  resource_server_id = keycloak_openid_client.client_with_authz.resource_server_id
  realm_id           = keycloak_realm.test.id
  name               = "authorization-permission"

  policies = [
    data.keycloak_openid_client_authorization_policy.default_permission.id,
  ]

  resources = [
    keycloak_openid_client_authorization_resource.resource.id,
  ]
}
```
