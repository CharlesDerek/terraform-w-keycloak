# keycloak_realm

Allows for creating and managing Realms within Keycloak.

A realm manages a logical collection of users, credentials, roles, and groups.
Users log in to realms and can be federated from multiple sources.

### Example Usage

```hcl
resource "keycloak_realm" "realm" {
    realm                   = "test"
    enabled                 = true
    display_name            = "test realm"
    display_name_html       = "<b>test realm</b>"

    login_theme          = "base"

    access_code_lifespan = "1h"
    ssl_required  = "external"
    password_policy = "upperCase(1) and length(8) and forceExpiredPasswordChange(365) and notUsername"
    attributes = {
      mycustomAttribute = "myCustomValue"
    }

    smtp_server {
        host = "smtp.example.com"
        from = "example@example.com"

        auth {
        	username = "tom"
        	password = "password"
        }
    }

    internationalization {
        supported_locales = [
            "en",
            "de",
            "es"
        ]
        default_locale    = "en"
    }

    security_defenses {
        headers {
            x_frame_options                     = "DENY"

        }

            permanent_lockout                 = false
            max_login_failures                = 30
            wait_increment_seconds            = 60
            quick_login_check_milli_seconds   = 1000

#### Atributes

Map, can be used to add custom attributes to a realm. Or perhaps influence a certain attribute that is not supported in this terraform-provider
